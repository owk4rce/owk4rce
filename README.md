### Hello there!

I've always thrived on making a positive impact, and helping others feel satisfied with my work has been my greatest driver. After graduating with a degree in Computer Science I explored my creative side as a game designer in a small studio. This experience fueled my love for using my imagination, which also finds expression in my writing of short stories and poems. While it was a short-lived adventure, I look back on it fondly.

After that I was working as a Technical Support Specialist for over 12 years. Starting with phone support, I built a reputation for exceptional customer service and eventually led the IT Department. My ability to patiently listen and understand people's concerns, even when solutions weren't immediately apparent, became my superpower.

However, my desire to proactively prevent issues rather than react to them drew me to QA. 

I am a highly motivated and results-oriented person with a strong attention to detail. I have a deep understanding of software development principles and user needs, and I am always looking for ways to improve the quality of products.

Currently, I am an intern at the Yandex Practicum Programming Workshop as a QA team member. We are working on a pet project, a web application for providing psychological assistance. Over the past months, I have developed my skills in working without clear product requirements, creating all test documentation, analyzing tasks, and mastering automation skills. In my work, I use GitHub, DevTools, Postman, Qase.io and Figma.
